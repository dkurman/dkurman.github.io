Doctoral Researcher, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE), PolyU, Hong Kong.

Currently, I am working on the Traffic Assignment problem. To be more specific, I am mastering MP formulation of Stochastic User Equilibrium (SUE). These days I am practicing with the Multinomial Logit based SUE (MNL), Cross-Nested Logit (CNL) based SUE, and Pair-Combinatorial Logit (PCL) based SUE formulations and their extentions.
